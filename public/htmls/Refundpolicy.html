        <h3>REFUND POLICY</h3>
        <p>
          Cancellation or refund policy is approved on a case-to-case basis at
          the discretion of the management.
          <br><br>
          If the student wishes to cancel any Offline/Online course after
          registration and payment of fees, an administration fee of Rs.2500 &amp;
          GST 18% will be deducted, and the remaining amount will be refunded.
          <br>
          Course cancellation must be requested at least ten (10) working days
          before the course commencement date.
          <br><br>
          The same policy applies to students who have paid the entire course
          fee. If a student discontinues in the middle of the course, no refund
          will be provided.
          <br><br>
          Students are not eligible for any refund if the course cancellation
          request is made less than ten (10) working days before the course
          commencement date.
          <br><br>
          If KISS TECH cancels an event/course, a 100% refund will be paid to
          the student within ten (10) days from the announcement date of
          cancellation.
          <br><br>
          KISS TECH reserves the right to postpone/cancel an event, or change
          the event location due to insufficient enrollments, instructor
          illness, or force majeure events (like floods, cyclones, earthquakes,
          epidemic or pandemic outbreak, etc.) or any other unfortunate
          situation. This will be communicated in writing.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The mode of refund may vary depending on
          circumstances.
          <br>
          - For refunds via Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking, it may take ten
          (10) to fourteen (14) working days to appear in the student’s account.
          This delay is due to bank policies beyond KISS TECH's control.
          <br>
          - For refunds via UPI or online transactions like IMPS, it will take
          24 hours to reflect in the student’s account.
          <br><br>
